    <h3>Should new coders learn HTML?</h3>
    <blockquote cite="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/is-html-a-programming-language/#should-new-coders-learn-html">
        Every browser uses HTML, as it defines the structure of the web. Thus, understanding the basics of HTML is important for new coders. If you end up doing any type of web development, you should definitely learn HTML. Knowledge of HTML syntax will help you with other programming frameworks, too.
